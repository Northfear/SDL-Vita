Quickly butchered together PS Vita gxm port of SDL 1.2 with 1.2.16 version bump and some minor fixes and optimizations:
- ~10% faster than vita2d version (at least for me)
- working 32 bpp
- front touchpad support (mouse emulation. should work with scaled/centered images too)

Thanks to:
- isage for SDL2 gxm port (https://github.com/isage/SDL-mirror)
- xerpi for libvita2d and xerpi, Cpasjuste and rsn8887 for original PS Vita SDL port

This is the Simple DirectMedia Layer, a general API that provides low
level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL,
and 2D framebuffer across multiple platforms.

The current version supports Linux, Windows CE/95/98/ME/XP/Vista, BeOS,
MacOS Classic, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, BSD/OS, Solaris, IRIX,
and QNX.  The code contains support for Dreamcast, Atari, AIX, OSF/Tru64,
RISC OS, SymbianOS, Nintendo DS, and OS/2, but these are not officially
supported.

SDL is written in C, but works with C++ natively, and has bindings to
several other languages, including Ada, C#, Eiffel, Erlang, Euphoria,
Guile, Haskell, Java, Lisp, Lua, ML, Objective C, Pascal, Perl, PHP,
Pike, Pliant, Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk.

This library is distributed under GNU LGPL version 2, which can be
found in the file  "COPYING".  This license allows you to use SDL
freely in commercial programs as long as you link with the dynamic
library.

The best way to learn how to use SDL is to check out the header files in
the "include" subdirectory and the programs in the "test" subdirectory.
The header files and test programs are well commented and always up to date.
More documentation is available in HTML format in "docs/index.html", and
a documentation wiki is available online at:
	http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/docwiki.cgi

The test programs in the "test" subdirectory are in the public domain.

Frequently asked questions are answered online:
